## TODO

- Add dynamic plus group
- Refine the breaks using a named matrix approach (ages "1-2", "3-4", years = ...); add expand_par_mat helper function
- Add Cadigan style age x year covariance function
- Use the age x year covariance function to improve space-year-size simulation
- Work on sim_distribution function
- Create more complex mortality simulation (autocovariance between years and age / separate Z and M effects / etc.)
- Consider random walk over time to help build a longer space-size-time series
- Look into building the simulation using R-INLA (see Chapter 8 of book)
- Perhaps sim_abundance should be based on SAM formulation?
- Consider adding temperature as a covariate
- Add ERROR checking
- Convert from sp to sf
- Convert draft paper to Rmd
