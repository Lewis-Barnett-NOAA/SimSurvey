# Abstract

A central question to fish stock assessments is: how many samples are needed to adequately represent the population being monitored? For assessments based on trawl surveys, our ability to estimate population characteristics, such as abundance at age, is affected by multiple levels of sampling (i.e. the number of sets, lengths and ages sampled in a survey). We therefore need to assess the impact of haul design and length and age sampling on survey accuracy to determine optimal sampling effort. In this study we simulated repeated stratified-random samples from a spatially correlated field of simulated fish. These samples were then analyzed and estimates of abundance at age were compared against a known truth. By varying the sampling protocol, we demonstrate that increasing the number of sets conducted per stratum provides the greatest gains in precision when sampling a clustered population. Increasing length and age sampling efforts also improved abundance estimates, but to a lesser extent and improvements were typically marginal, and sometimes squandered, when sub-sampling effort was increased. These results indicate that high levels of length and age sampling effort can be scaled back without significant losses to precision and, in some cases, estimates of abundance at age may be improved by reducing sub-sampling effort. Time saved by reducing said sampling may afford more time to conduct additional sets and/or increase sampling efforts of other species. While this simulation is tailored to a specific case, the method may be adapted to different systems and survey procedures.

# Introduction

Fisheries-independent trawl surveys have become an increasingly important research tool for the management of dynamic fish stocks. These surveys provide reliable indices of population abundance as well as estimates of various population characteristics such as length and age frequencies [@Pennington1998]. While costly to obtain, this information forms the basis of of many stock assessments models used throughout the world. Effective and informed management decisions therefore require surveys that maximize information while minimizing the expense of data collection. Determining the number of samples required to adequately characterize a fish population is particularly challenging since data tend to be collected across one or more stages [@Aanes2015]. Optimal survey design is further complicated by the fact that trawls sample clusters of fish that tend to have similar characteristics, such as length, age and stomach contents. This phenomenon results in samples with positive intra-haul correlation, which can markedly reduce the effective sample size for estimating length and age frequencies of the target population [@Pennington1994; @Pennington2002; @Stewart2014]. The complexities of multi-stage sampling and intra-haul correlation make it difficult to answer the question *"how much sampling is enough?"*  

Two main approaches have been applied to try and answer this question: one involves statistical estimators of effective sample size [@Pennington2002; @Stewart2014], and the other employs resampling methods to test alternate sampling protocol [@Cervino2006; @Zhang2013]. Both approaches have shown that lengths are usually oversampled and a reduction in said sampling can often be done without significant loss of accuracy [@Pennington2002]. The same result holds for other positively correlated characteristics, such as age [@Coggins2013] and stomach contents [@Bogstad1995]. Pennington and VÃ¸lstad [-@Pennington1994] concluded that the best way to improve the accuracy of surveys with strong intra-haul correlation is to take fewer samples per sampling unit and increase the total number of sampling locations. Few studies, however, have tested these conclusions using simulations. Simulations are a useful approach for informing the design of surveys [@sutherland2006] and they have been used widely for exploring the number of samples needed to obtain estimates with reasonable precision [e.g. distance sampling surveys; @thomas2010]. A key advantage of a pure simulation approach is that "true" population size and all stages of sampling can be controlled (set, length and age sampling protocol). The relative effects of each stage of sampling on our perception of the "truth" can then be tested. This level of testing is of particular importance for age composition estimates, and the contemporary age-based assessment models that rely on these estimates, as they are affected by all stages of sampling. A key challenge, of course, is building a simulation that emulates reality.  

The objective of this paper is to use a realistic simulation to evaluate the efficacy of various sampling protocol. First we simulated a spatially autocorrelated target population, and then we simulated surveys over this field. Set density was varied across surveys, as was length and age sampling efforts. Estimates of abundance at age were then obtained using a standard stratified approach [@Smith1981] and deviation from the truth was assessed. Given previous findings, we predict that the greatest gains in precision will come from increasing the number of hauls; increased sampling of correlated variables (length and age) on a set by set basis will be relatively ineffective. The bottom trawl survey of cod (*Gadus morhua*) in NAFO division 3Ps, Newfoundland, was used as a case study for this analysis. While our case study is specific, we also hope that the approach presented here will provide a framework for optimizing sampling protocol for an array of species with different life-histories and distributions. To facilitate future work and collaborations, we have developed an R package for conducting the tests presented in this paper (https://github.com/PaulRegular/SimSurvey).


# Methods

The SimSurvey package was written in the programming language R [@R] and, in short, the package allows for the simulation of stratified-random surveys of an age-structured population that varies in space and time. SimSurvey relies heavily on functions from the data.table [@dowle2017], raster [@hijmans2016] and plotly [@sievert2018] packages for their efficient data processing, geographic and plotting facilities, respectively. All the source R code behind SimSurvey is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PaulRegular/SimSurvey) and the 0.1.0 release of the package can be installed via GitHub:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PaulRegular/SimSurvey@v0.1.0") 
```


## Case study

The construction of the SimSurvey package was motivated by a regional need for assessing the sampling design of trawl surveys conducted along the Newfoundland and Labrador shelf by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. As a tangible first step, we focused our efforts on emulating data from the survey of cod in NAFO division 3Ps since it is one of the most dynamic and heavily sampled stocks in the region. Below we outline the equations behind a series of SimSurvey functions that were used to simulate survey data with similar features to data obtained by the survey of 3Ps cod. The settings were iteratively modified until it was difficult to distinguish the simulated data from real survey data. Here we evaluate the efficacy of alternate sampling protocol by assessing deviation between stratified estimates of abundance [@Smith1981] from the true abundance available to the survey. While assessing model-based analyses was an option, we focused on the design-based stratified analysis for simplicity and because of its widespread use. See Table \@ref(tab:par) for a description of the code used to generate the case study results.

## Simulate abundance

The simulation starts with a common cohort model where the abundance at age $a$ in year $y$ ($N_{a,y}$) equals the abundance of that cohort in the previous year multiplied by the survival rate, which is expressed in terms of total mortality ($Z_{a,y}$):

$$N_{a,y} = N_{a-1,y-1} e^{-Z_{a-1,y-1}}$$
Here, numbers at age in the first year are filled via exponential decay, $N_{a,1} = N_{a-1,1} e^{-Z_{a-1,1}}$, numbers at age 1 (i.e. recruits) vary around a baseline value, $log(N_{1,y}) = log(\mu_r) + \epsilon_{y}$, and total mortality is set to a baseline level plus process error, $log(Z_{a,y}) = log(\mu_Z) + \delta_{a,y}$. The error around the recruitment process was set to follow a random walk, $\epsilon_{y} \sim N(\epsilon_{y - 1}, \sigma_{r}^{2})$, and the process error was simulated using the covariance structure described in Cadigan [-@Cadigan2016], $\delta_{a,y} \sim N(0, \Sigma_{a,y})$. The covariance across ages and years is controlled by a process error variance parameter ($\sigma_{\delta}^2$) along with age and year correlation parameters ($\varphi_{\delta, age}$ and $\varphi_{\delta, year}$, respectively). This structure allows for autocorrelation in process errors across ages and years (i.e. total mortality can be made to be more similar for fish that are closer together in age and time). Abundance at age is then converted to abundance at length using the original von Bertalanffy growth curve [@Cailliet2006]:

$$log(l) = log(l_{\infty} - (l_{\infty} - l_0) e^{-Ka}) + \varepsilon$$

Where $l_{\infty}$ is the mean asymptotic length, $l_0$ is length at birth, $K$ is the growth rate parameter and the error is assumed to follow the normal distribution, $\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma_{l}^2)$. Abundance in discrete length groups, $l_{group}^{N}$, was determined by using this formula to calculate the probability of being within a specific length group given age and then using the resultant length-age-key to convert abundance at age to abundance at length. Overall, this  formulation allows for the simulation of an array of population dynamics that one might expect to observe. 

Abundance is simulated using the `sim_abundance` function and the settings used for our case study are shown in Table \@ref(tab:par). These settings are also the defaults of the function. This function has a simple structure and requires the specification of a series of `ages` and `years` along with functions for simulating recruitment (`R`), total mortality (`Z`) and growth (`growth`). The package includes the functions `sim_R`, `sim_Z` and `sim_vonB` for simulating recruitment, total mortality and growth, respectively. These functions are "closures" [i.e. functions that contain data and return functions; @wickham2014] and this structure was chosen to avoid the repeated specifications of ages and years. The use of closures also allows users to use their own closures with a similar structure but different underlying formula. Overall, the function provides a simple tool for simulating a range dynamic age-structured populations. For instance, below we simulate a relatively long and short lived species:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
set.seed(438)
a <- sim_abundance(ages = 1:20,
                   R = sim_R(mean = 3e+07),
                   Z = sim_Z(mean = 0.5))
b <- sim_abundance(ages = 1:6,
                   R = sim_R(mean = 1e+10),
                   Z = sim_Z(mean = 0.8))
```

The `sim_abundance` function returns a list with the sequence of ages (`ages`), sequence of years (`years`), sequence of lengths (`lengths`), numbers of recruits across all years (`R`), numbers at age in the first year (`N0`), total mortality matrix (`Z`), abundance at age matrix (`N`), abundance at length matrix (`N_at_length`) and the function supplied to the `growth` argument (`sim_length`). The growth function is retained for later use in `sim_survey` to simulate lengths given simulated catch at age in a simulated survey.

The package also includes several plotting function for making quick plotly-based [@sievert2018] interactive visuals of the simulated population. The plots output from the below code are combined into Figure \@ref(fig:surface).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
plot_surface(a, mat = "N")
plot_surface(b, mat = "N")
```


```{r surface, fig.cap = "- Plots produced by `plot_surface` when supplied an list produced by `sim_abundance` with settings that simulate a relatively a) long and b) short lived species. The abundance at age matrix (`N`) is displayed by default; the `mat` argument can be used to specify another matrix contained within the supplied list, such as `Z`."}

set.seed(438)
a <- sim_abundance(ages = 1:20,
                   R = sim_R(mean = 3e+07),
                   Z = sim_Z(mean = 0.5))
b <- sim_abundance(ages = 1:6,
                   R = sim_R(mean = 1e+10),
                   Z = sim_Z(mean = 0.8))

pa <- plot_surface(a, mat = "N", scene = "scene1", showscale = FALSE) %>% 
  add_labels(x = 0.05, y = 0.9, text = "a)")
pb <- plot_surface(b, mat = "N", scene = "scene2", showscale = FALSE) %>% 
  add_labels(x = 0.05, y = 0.9, text = "b)")

p <- subplot(pa, pb) %>%
  layout(scene = list(domain = list(x = c(0, 0.5), y = c(0, 1))),
         scene2 = list(domain = list(x = c(0.5, 1), y = c(0, 1)),
                       xaxis = list(title = "Age"),
                       yaxis = list(title = "Year"),
                       zaxis = list(title = "N")))

knitr::include_graphics("figures/plot_surface.png")

```



## Simulate spatial distribution

The next step in the simulation is to distribute the abundance at age matrix simulated using the cohort model throughout a spatial field. Here, a grid of $s$ locations was generated with a resolution of $R$ and a depth gradient. The depth gradient was set-up to have a sigmoid shape with a depth range of $[d_{min}, d_{max}]$, shelf depth of $d_{shelf}$ and a shelf width of $w_{shelf}$. The grid is divided into $N_{div}$ divisions and $N_{strat}$ depth-based strata. The simulated population is distributed through the grid by simulating spatial-temporal noise controlled by a parabolic relationship with depth and covariance between ages, years and space

$$\begin{aligned}log(N_{a,y,s}) &= log(N_{a,y}) + \eta_{a,y,s} \\ \eta_{a,y,s} &= \frac{(d_s - \mu_{d}) ^ 2}{2 \sigma_d^2} + \xi_{a,y,s} \end{aligned}$$

Where $d_s$ is the depth in a specific cell of the grid, $\mu_d$ is the mean depth where abundance is typically highest and $\sigma_d$ controls the width or dispersion of abundance around the mean. This helps simulate depth preferences of particular fish. Residual noise $\xi_{a,y,s}$ is added to this depth relationship using a combination of MatÃ©rn covariance, to control the level of spatial aggregation, and the age-year covariance described in Cadigan [-@Cadigan2016], to control the level of similarity in distributions across ages and years. Spatial correlations was controlled by a smoothing ($\lambda$) and scaling parameter ($\kappa$) [here we approximate $\kappa$ from a range parameter ($r$), $\kappa = \sqrt{8 \lambda} / r$; @Blangiardo2015] and correlation across ages and years was controlled by $\varphi_{\xi, age}$ and $\varphi_{\xi, year}$, respectively. The overall variance of the process was controlled by $\sigma_{\xi}^2$. In short, this formulation allows control of depth preferences, the level of spatial aggregation and the amount of age and year specific clustering. Note that $\eta_{a,y,s}$ is forced to sum to one in each year to ensure that the total population of each age for each year through the grid equals the number simulated by the cohort model. Also note that numbers were rounded such that a discrete number of fish are in each cell of the grid. A more detailed description of the space-age-year covariance is included in Appendix 1. Note that the the distributions of specific length groups were not simulated because of the greater computational cost of storing spatially dis-aggregated abundance across all length groups. 

The `make_grid` function is used to generate a survey grid for use in the `sim_distribution` function. The output from `make_grid` is a raster object [@hijmans2016] with four layers: `depth`, `cell`, `division` and `strat`. If a more detailed and realistic grid is required, users can manually generate their own survey grid using real data and this grid can be supplied to `sim_distribution` if the same structure is used. The settings used to make the grid used in our case study are shown in Table \@ref(tab:par) and these settings are also the defaults. Below we generate and plot (combined in Figure \@ref(fig:grid)) a default grid and another grid with four divisions and a more linear gradient in depth.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

a <- make_grid(n_div = 1, shelf_depth = 200,
               shelf_width = 100, depth_range = c(0, 1000))
b <- make_grid(n_div = 4, shelf_depth = 500, 
               shelf_width = 0, depth_range = c(0, 1000))
plot_grid(a)
plot_grid(b)

```


```{r grid, fig.cap = "- Plots produced by `plot_grid` when supplied an raster object produced by `make_grid` a) using default settings and b) settings that generate a more linear depth gradient. In these plots, the color gradient represents depth, the grey lines deliniate divisions and white lines deliniate strata."}

a <- make_grid() %>% 
  plot_grid(showscale = TRUE) %>% 
  add_labels(x = 0, y = 1, text = "a)")
b <- make_grid(n_div = 4, shelf_depth = 500, shelf_width = 0, depth_range = c(0, 1000)) %>% 
  plot_grid(showscale = FALSE) %>% 
  add_labels(x = 0.01, y = 1, text = "b)")
p <- subplot(a, b)

export_plot(p, file = "analysis/paper/figures/plot_grid.png", width = 800, height = 430)
knitr::include_graphics("figures/plot_grid.png")

```

The `sim_distribution` function distributes the population simulated using `sim_abundance` throughout the grid generated using `make_grid`. Table \@ref(tab:par) outlines the default settings used for the function and the case study. In addition to supplying objects produced by `sim_abundance` and `make_grid`, this function requires two closures that describe the age-year-space covariance and the relationship with depth. Here we use `sim_ays_covar` and `sim_parabola` to control these relationships and a wide range of age and year specific distributions can be obtained by tweaking a few parameters in these closures. Below we run a default `sim_distribution` call, which generates a population that forms tight clusters that are more strongly correlated across years than ages, and another call that generates a population that is more diffuse (i.e. wider range) and exhibits stronger correlation across ages than years. Distributions can also be forced to be the same across ages and years by using the `group_ages` and `group_years`, respectively, arguments in the `sim_ays_covar` closure. In other words, these parameters can be modified to control the degree of age-specific clustering and inter-annual site-fidelity exhibited by the simulated population. Note that the resolution of the default grid is high and, as such, the simulations below may take minutes to complete. Also note that the key functions in the SimSurvey package have been set-up to be pipe [`%>%`; @bache2014] friendly.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, cache = TRUE}

set.seed(438)
a <- sim_abundance() %>% 
  sim_distribution(ays_covar = sim_ays_covar(range = 300,
                                             phi_year = 0.9,
                                             phi_age = 0.5))
b <- sim_abundance() %>% 
  sim_distribution(ays_covar = sim_ays_covar(range = 2000,
                                             phi_year = 0.2,
                                             phi_age = 0.9))

```

This function retains all the data simulated by `sim_abundance` and adds a data.table [@dowle2017], named `sp_N`, with abundance (`N`) split by `age`, `year` and `cell`. The function also retains the grid object and converts these data into a data.table, named `grid_xy`, with headers `x`, `y`, `depth`, `cell`, `division` and `strat`. The `sp_N` object can be merge with the `grid_xy` data by `cell` to associate abundance with specific locations, depth, divisions or strata. The `plot_distribution` function can be used to provide a quick visual of the distribution across ages and years. The code below will generate interactive plots with an Age-Year slider, however, for this paper we present a facet plot of the simulated data in Figure \@ref(fig:distribution).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

plot_distribution(a, ages = 1:3, years = 1:3, type = "heatmap")
plot_distribution(b, ages = 1:3, years = 1:3, type = "heatmap")

```


```{r distribution, fig.cap = "- Distribution plots of a population simulated using `sim_distribution` that forms a) tight clusters with stronger correlation through years than ages, and b) relatively diffuse clusters with stronger correlation through ages than years."}

facet_distribution <- function(data) {
  ay <- expand.grid(age = 1:3, year = 1:3)
  plot_list <- vector("list", nrow(ay))
  for (i in 1:3) {
    for (j in 1:3) {
      p <- plot_distribution(data, ages = i, years = j, type = "heatmap") %>% 
        hide_colorbar() %>% 
        layout(autosize = FALSE, width = 100, height = 100,
               margin = list(l = 0, r = 0, b = 0, t = 0, pad = 0))
      plot_list[[which(ay$age == i & ay$year == j)]] <- p
    }
  }
  subplot(plot_list, nrows = 3, shareX = TRUE, shareY = TRUE, margin = 0.01) %>% 
    layout(autosize = FALSE, width = 300, height = 300,
           margin = list(t = 20, l = 20, b = 10, r = 10))
} 

a_plots <- facet_distribution(a)
b_plots <- facet_distribution(b)

p <- subplot(a_plots, b_plots) %>% 
  add_labels(text = rep(c("Age 1", "Age 2", "Age 3"), 2), x = c(0.04, 0.20, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95), y = rep(0.995, 6), yshift = 20) %>% 
  add_labels(text = rep(c("Year 3", "Year 2", "Year 1"), 2), x = c(rep(0.005, 3), rep(0.54, 3)), y = c(0.08, 0.5, 0.92), xshift = -20, textangle = -90) %>%

knitr::include_graphics("figures/plot_distribution.png")

```


## Simulate survey

The final step in the simulation is to conduct a stratified random survey over the age-year-space array generated using formula described above. The area of each strata is calculated and this is used to define the sets to allocate to each strata under a particular set density, $D_{sets}$. The allocated number of cells are randomly selected in each strata and the number of fish caught in each set is calculated by applying binomial sampling of the fish in each sampled cell by the proportion of the area covered by the trawl and the catchability of each age:

$$n_{a,y,s} \sim Bin(N_{a,y,s}, \frac{A_{trawl}}{A_{cell}} q_a )$$
Where $n_{a,y,s}$ is the number of fish sampled by a set, $A_{trawl}$ indicates the area covered by the trawl, $A_{cell}$ is the area of a grid cell (i.e. $R^2$), and $q_a$ is the catchability coefficient of each age. Here, catchabilities were defined using a logistic curve controlled by a steepness, $k$, and midpoint parameter, $x_0$. The lengths of the fish sampled by the set are then simulated using the von Bertalanffy growth equation found above in the [Simulate abundance] section. Depending on the number of fish caught, sub-sampling is then conducted. Specifically, a maximum number of lengths are measured per set, $M_{lengths}$, and a maximum number of ages, $M_{ages}$, are sampled per length group, $l_{group}$, per division. 

The function `sim_survey` can be used to simulate data from one survey over a population simulated using `sim_distribution`. This function simulates the sampling process of the survey and, as such, requires a closure for defining catchability as a function of age and definitions of the design of the survey. Specifically, the `q` argument requires a closure, such as `sim_logistic`, for defining the probability of catching specific age groups, trawl dimensions are defined in the `trawl_dim` argument, and set, length and age sampling effort are defined using the `set_den`, `lengths_cap` and `ages_cap` arguments, respectively. Multiple simulations of the same survey can be run using the `n_sims` argument, however, it is important not to request large numbers of simulations because this function can quickly deplete a computers RAM. Defaults used in the function and for the case study roughly correspond to the assumed catchability in NAFO division 3Ps as well as the sampling protocol used in the survey of this stock (Table \@ref(tab:par)). Below we use `sim_survey` to simulate two surveys over the same population, of which one is set-up to have higher sampling effort than the other.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, cache = TRUE}

set.seed(438)
pop <- sim_abundance() %>% 
  sim_distribution()
a <- pop %>% 
  sim_survey(n_sims = 5,
             set_den = 1 / 1000,
             lengths_cap = 100,
             ages_cap = 5)
b <- pop %>% 
  sim_survey(n_sims = 5,
             set_den = 5 / 1000,
             lengths_cap = 500,
             ages_cap = 25)

```

Again, this function retains all the objects listed in the output of `sim_distribution` and adds data.tables that detail the set locations (`setdet`) and sampling details (`samp`). Catchability corrected abundance matrices, named `I` and `I_at_length`, are also produced and added to the output; these matrices are useful for comparing the true abundance available to the survey to abundance estimates obtained using survey-based or model-based analyses of the simulated survey data. Specific surveys can be explored using the `plot_survey` function, which uses plotly [@sievert2018] and crosstalk [@cheng2016] in the background to link the bubble plot of aggregate set catch to the histogram of lengths and ages sampled to facilitate explorations of set-specific catches. The plots generated below have been combined here into a static plot for this paper (Figure \@ref(fig:survey)).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

plot_survey(a, which_sim = 1, which_year = 20)
plot_survey(b, which_sim = 1, which_year = 20)

```


```{r survey, fig.cap = "- Bubble plots and histograms of set catches produced by `plot_survey` when supplied survey data simulated using `sim_survey` under relatively a) high and b) low sampling effort. Histograms of length and age composition include the distribution caught and sampled overlaid with a line of the true distribution of length and ages available to the survey. Note that the first simulation of the survey in year 20 is depicted here."}

plot_a <- plot_survey(a, which_sim = 1, which_year = 20) %>% 
  add_labels(text = "a)", x = 0, y = 1, yshift = 5, xshift = -5) %>% 
  layout(margin = list(l = 10, r = 10, t = 10, b = 10))
plot_b <- plot_survey(b, which_sim = 1, which_year = 20) %>% 
  add_labels(text = "b)", x = 0, y = 1, yshift = 5, xshift = -5) %>% 
  layout(margin = list(l = 10, r = 10, t = 10, b = 10))

## plotly::subplot was not amenable to combining these two plots, I therefore used ImageMagick to combine a and b

paths <- c(a = "analysis/paper/figures/plot_survey_a.png", b = "analysis/paper/figures/plot_survey_b.png")
export_plot(plot_a, file = paths["a"], width = 800, height = 400)
export_plot(plot_b, file = paths["b"], width = 800, height = 400)

image_a <- magick::image_read(paths["a"])
image_b <- magick::image_read(paths["b"])
p <- magick::image_append(c(image_a, image_b), stack = TRUE)
magick::image_write(p, path = "analysis/paper/figures/plot_survey.png")

knitr::include_graphics("figures/plot_survey.png")

```

As noted above, the amount of RAM a user's computer has may limit the utility of the `sim_survey` function for running thousands of simulations of the same survey. The `sim_survey_parallel` function was therefore constructed to facilitate the running of thousands of simulations without running into RAM limitations. This function is set-up to run multiple `sim_survey` calls in parallel using the doParallel package [@weston2015] and, as such, multiple loops can be run using the `n_loops` argument and within each loop multiple simulations can be run (controled using the `n_sims` argument). Total simulations will be the product of `n_loops` and `n_sims` arguments. If more than one core (`cores`) is specified, then the simulations will be run in parallel to speed up the process. Low numbers of `n_sims` and high numbers of `n_loops` will be easier on RAM, but may be slower. The optimum ratio of `n_sims` to `n_loops` will depend on the amount of RAM and number of cores the user's computer has. In any case, this function simplifies the process of running thousands of simulations of the same survey and the simulated data can then be supplied to survey-based or model-based analyses that require simulation testing. Because the SimSurvey package was constructed in a context where survey-based analyses are commonplace, specifically stratified analyses, the package facilities include functions for calculating and assessing bias and precision of stratified estimates of abundance.

## Stratified analysis



A series of `r # nrow(sim$surveys)` surveys were tested using an array of different sampling protocol outlined in Table \@ref(tab:tests). Each survey was simulated `r # max(sim$age_strat_error$sim)` times over the same population and samples were run through a stratified analysis [@Smith1981] to obtain annual estimates of total abundance ($\hat{I}_{y,k}$), abundance at length ($\hat{I}_{l,y,k}$) and abundance at age ($\hat{I}_{a,y,k}$). We used root-mean-squared error (RMSE) as a measure of the precision and bias of the abundance at age estimates from each survey:

$$RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{ \sum_{a = 1}^{N_a} \sum_{y = 1}^{N_y} \sum_{k = 1}^{N_k} (\hat{I}_{a,y,k} - I_{a,y})^2}{N_a N_y N_k}}$$
Where $N_a$, $N_y$, and $N_k$ are the number of years, ages and simulations, respectively, and $I_{a,y}$ is the true abundance available to the survey (i.e. catchability corrected abundance; $I_{a,y} = q_a N_{a,y}$). RMSE was also calculated for abundance at length estimates. Intra-haul correlation (i.e. intraclass correlation) of set catch was also calculated by fitting a mixed-model to the lengths data with set as a random effect [fit using the lme4 package; @Bates2015]; variance estimates from this model were then plugged into the ICC(1) formula presented in McGraw and Wong [-@Mcgraw1996]. All simulations and analyses were conducted using `r substr(version$version.string, 1, 15)` [@R2017] and the code has been developed into a package called `SimSurvey` to facilitate future work and collaboration (https://github.com/PaulRegular/SimSurvey).

## Assumptions

Like any model, this simulation is a simplification of a much more complex reality. For instance, the population is assumed to aggregate by age-class and be uniformly distributed within a cell when, in the real-world, they may aggregate by length and form finer-scale clusters. The survey is also an instantaneous snapshot of the population, meaning that the population is assumed to be in the same location from the beginning to the end of the survey. Also, fish are aged at random within length bins and ages are estimated without error. Finally, area trawled is assumed to be perfectly standard. This is a short, non-inclusive, list of additional variability that likely occurs in the real-world but was not implemented here for simplicity.


# Results

```{r icc, cache = TRUE}
len_samp <- merge(sim$setdet, sim$samp, by = "set")
len_samp <- len_samp[len_samp$sim == 1 & len_samp$measured, ]
sim_icc <- round(icc(len_samp$length, len_samp$set), 1)
sim_icc <- sprintf("%.2f", sim_icc)
real_icc <- "0.70" # calculated in the file "imatate_cod_data.R"
```


A dynamic population that varies across ages, time and space was simulated with the parameter settings used here (Table \@ref(tab:par)). Figure \@ref(fig:sp) depicts the aggregate distribution of the population in one year of the simulation and the corresponding catches of one stratified random survey over this population. Layered within this, of course, is the distributions of each age, as well as age and length sampling details. Though age-specific details are not depicted for simplicity, the general pattern of spatial aggregation apparent in Figure \@ref(fig:sp) is similar across all ages. That is, all ages tend to aggregate in fairly dense clusters and low-density zones are fairly wide ranging. The survey, therefore, tends to be characterized by regions with large catches interspersed with regions of no catch (Figure \@ref(fig:sp)). The samples within each successful set are also dynamic and rarely include all age groups. This is because only moderate correlation was imposed on the distributions of ages 1-5+, allowing individuals of different ages to occupy different locations. This results in an intra-haul correlation of approximately `r sim_icc`, which, in this case, is of equal magnitude to the intra-haul correlation observed across more than 20 years of survey data of 3Ps cod.

The stratified analyses run on these simulated data provided estimates of total abundance, abundance at length and abundance at age, and different stages of sampling affect these estimates. Specifically, set density affects all estimates, length sampling affects estimates of abundance at length and abundance at age, and age sampling affects abundance at age estimates. Figure \@ref(fig:tot) depicts the consequences of different set densities on the estimates of total abundance available to the survey through the simulated series. It is clear from this figure that the probability envelopes are tighter (i.e. estimates are more precise) and bias is negligible. Likewise, abundance at length and abundance at age estimates are more precise as set density is increased (Figure \@ref(fig:length), \@ref(fig:age), \@ref(fig:year)). With the exception of a length sampling protocol of 10 measurements per set ($M_{lengths}$ = 10), there appears to be little difference in the estimates of abundance at length when the number of measurements are capped at 100 ($M_{lengths}$ = 100) or 1000 ($M_{lengths}$ = 1000; Figure \@ref(fig:length)). Some downward bias is apparent in the abundance at length estimates, especially at larger lengths, under the low to medium set density scenarios with low length sampling effort ($D_{sets}$ = 0.0005 or 0.002 and $M_{lengths}$ = 10; Figure \@ref(fig:length)). Upward or downward bias in abundance at age estimates is apparent in all cases except the high set density and high length sampling scenario ($D_{sets}$ = 0.01 and $M_{lengths}$ = 1000; Figure \@ref(fig:age), \@ref(fig:year)). Under both low and medium set densities ($D_{sets}$ = 0.0005 and 0.02, respectively), increasing length sampling effort from 10 or 100 measurements per set to 1000 appears to increase bias or reduce precision slightly (Figure \@ref(fig:age), \@ref(fig:year)).

For a less visual approach to assessing precision and bias, RMSE results are presented in Figures \@ref(fig:error-lines) and \@ref(fig:error-wireframe) and Table \@ref(tab:comp). Figure \@ref(fig:error-lines) depicts the effects of set density and length sampling effort on abundance at length and abundance at age estimates. In all cases, increases in set density results in large declines in RMSE (Figure \@ref(fig:error-lines)). For abundance at length estimates, RMSE declines as the number of lengths measured increases, however, gains plateau beyond a cretin point. Likewise, RMSE of abundance at age estimates decline with increased length sampling effort, but RMSE does not plateau in all set density scenarios (Figure \@ref(fig:error-lines)). While RMSE continues to decline with increased length sampling effort under the high set density scenarios ($D_{sets}$ = 0.005 to 0.01 sets / km^2^), RMSE reaches a plateau and then increases with increased length sampling effort under the medium to low set density scenarios ($D_{sets}$ = 0.002 to 0.0005 sets / km^2^; Figure \@ref(fig:error-lines)). In many cases, RMSE for both metrics is lower for scenarios with higher set density but lower length sampling effort (Figure \@ref(fig:error-lines)). Similar patterns are apparent in Figure \@ref(fig:error-wireframe) and Table \@ref(tab:comp), which focus on the consequences of set density and length and age sampling protocol on the estimates of abundance at age. Again, RMSE clearly declines with increases to set density and sometimes declines with increased length sampling effort (Figure \@ref(fig:error-wireframe)). Under both low and medium set density scenarios ($D_{sets}$ = 0.005 to 0.01 sets / km^2^), measuring a maximum of 100 fish per set appears to be better than measuring a maximum of 1000 fish per set (Figure \@ref(fig:error-wireframe); Table \@ref(tab:comp)). Decreasing the age sampling protocol below 10 ages sampled per set per length group appears to result in relatively small increases to RMSE (Figure \@ref(fig:error-wireframe); Table \@ref(tab:comp)).


# Discussion

The simple simulation presented here revealed some expected and unexpected patterns. First, there were clear improvements to precision in all population estimates as the number of sets were increased. This result was expected as it aligns with a basic principle of survey design that the precision and representativeness of a survey increases as the number of sampling units are increased [@sutherland2006]. Second, stratified estimates of abundance at age were often biased and, in some cases, estimates were poorer when sub-sampling effort was increased. This result was unexpected because design-based estimators, such as the stratified analysis applied here, are expected to be unbiased [@smith1990] and increases to sub-sampling effort was expected to be relatively ineffective, not detrimental. Results from stratified estimates of abundance at length, in contrast, better align with these expectations. By deduction, these results indicate that the issue stems from the intervening age-length key and not the design-based estimator.

Using an age-length key in conjunction with the length distribution to estimate abundance at age is standard procedure in the analysis of fisheries-independent survey data as only a small fraction of the catch is typically aged. This is because the aging procedure is costly and time-consuming whereas length measurements are relatively easy to obtain. Ages are generally determined from length-stratified sub-samples of the catch and raw proportions of age-at-length are used to assign ages to fish in specific length groups. Age-length keys are usually constructed at larger spatial scales because there are rarely enough samples to stratify these data. Here we construct one age-length key for the division, as is done for the analysis of 3Ps cod. There is, however, a potential cost to the spatial scale of the key. Namely, it is unlikely that one age-length key is representative for the whole region because the probability of being a specific age given length varies in space [@Berg2012]. This would not be an issue if there was no size (age) specific clustering, however, this may not always be the case because different size groups often occur in different places because of ontogenetic habitat shifts [@dahlgren2000; @galaiduk2017]. For instance, it is not uncommon for populations to form distinct nursery and spawning areas [@marteinsdottir2000; @booth2000]. Because different age groups sometimes occur in different places, the translation of lengths to ages may be biased by the samples used to generate the age-length key. This bias is perhaps compounded by the length-stratified sampling of ages such that the ages sampled may be skewed towards sets with the most catch, especially under scenarios where length sampling effort is high. If this is the case, then the representativeness of the age-length key to the whole population could be diminished by excessive length sampling. 

The negative consequences of excessive length sampling on abundance at age estimates are most apparent under the low set density scenarios. The precision of the estimates are also the poorest when fewer sets are conducted. Sets, however, are the most costly sample to obtain and, as such, the set densities of fisheries-independent surveys tend to be on the lower end of the scenarios presented in this paper. The set density of the multi-species survey conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada in the Newfoundland region, for instance, ranges between 0.001 and 0.002 sets / km^2^. Length sampling effort, in contrast, tends to be on the higher end of the scenarios presented here because lengths are relatively cheap and easy to obtain. Again, using Fisheries and Oceans Canada sampling protocol from the Newfoundland region as an example, it is not uncommon for length sampling effort to be capped at 500 measurements per set. The results presented in this paper paradoxically suggest that better abundance at age estimates are obtained by lowering the length sampling cap. Results also indicate that reductions to length sampling effort would not significantly impact abundance at length estimates. Nonetheless, it is hard to be prescriptive because this simulation is far from a perfect reflection of reality and it focuses on one case study. Further research is required on the consequences of some of the assumptions of this simulation as well as the interaction between age-specific clustering, length-stratified sampling and the age-length key. Ideally, the simulation would also include multiple species with different life-histories and distributions, and also integrate a cost component to assess the trade-offs between information and cost. Finally, it would be interesting to test alternate analyses of these data that may account for the spatial structure of the age-length key [e.g. @Berg2012].

While much work has yet to be done, results from the simple simulation echo the growing body of literature which concludes that extra sub-sampling is an ineffective means of improving estimates relative to sampling more locations [@Pennington1994; @Pennington2002; @Stewart2014; @Bogstad1995; @Coggins2013; @Zhang2013]. In general, the most significant source of variation in fisheries-independent surveys stems from set-to-set variation, and not variability from individual sub-samples. This is largely because fish caught together tend to be more similar than those in the general population [@Pennington1994]. Therefore, if the goal of a trawl survey is to maximize information, it is likely better to stop collecting psudoreplicates and, instead, focus efforts on other species or the next set.

# Appendix 1: age-year-space covariance

The simulation applied in this paper was set-up to control covariance across ages, years and space. To do this we used a combination of MatÃ©rn covariance, to control the level of spatial aggregation, and the age-year covariance described in Cadigan [-@Cadigan2016], to control the level of similarity in distributions across ages and years. As described in Appendix A in Cadigan [-@Cadigan2016], the age-year covariance can be broken down into a series of AR(1) processes. We integrate MatÃ©rn covariance into this series of equations:

$$\xi_{a,y,s} \sim \left\{\begin{matrix} MVN\left (0, \frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{(1 - \varphi_{age}^2)(1 - \varphi_{year}^2)} \boldsymbol{R}_s \right ) & a = 1, y = 1 & \\  MVN\left (\varphi_{year} \xi_{1, y - 1, s}, \frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{(1 - \varphi_{age}^2)} \boldsymbol{R}_s \right ) & a = 1, y > 1 & \\ MVN\left (\varphi_{age} \xi_{a - 1, 1, s}, \frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{(1 - \varphi_{year}^2)} \boldsymbol{R}_s \right ) & a > 1, y = 1 & \\ MVN\left (\varphi_{year} \xi_{a, y - 1, s} + \varphi_{age} (\xi_{a - 1, y, s} - \varphi_{year} \xi_{a - 1, y - 1, s}), \sigma_\xi^2 \boldsymbol{R}_s \right ) & a > 1, y > 1 & \end{matrix}\right.$$

Where $MVN$ indicates the multivariate normal distribution, $\sigma_\xi^2$ controls the variance of the process, $\varphi_{\xi, age}$ and $\varphi_{\xi, year}$ control correlation in the age and year dimension and $\boldsymbol{R}_s$ is defined by MatÃ©rn correlation:

$$\boldsymbol{R}_s = \frac{2^{1-\lambda}}{\Gamma(\lambda)} (\kappa \left |s_i - s_j \right|) K_{\lambda}(\kappa \left |s_i - s_j \right|)$$
where $\left |s_i - s_j \right|$ is the Euclidean distance between two locations, $\Gamma$ is the gamma function, $K_{\lambda}$ denotes the modified Bessel function of the second kind, and $\lambda$ and $\kappa$ control the smoothness and scale of the spatial process [@Blangiardo2015]. With this structure, simulated error is correlated across ages, years and space.
