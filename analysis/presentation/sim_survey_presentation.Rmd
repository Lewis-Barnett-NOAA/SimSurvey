- Conducted by many RFMOs
- Becoming increasingly important in stock assessment
- Very costly üí∞
- General goal:
    - Maximize information & minimize expenses

## Fisheries-independent trawl surveys {.columns-2}

- How much survey effort is enough?
    - Difficult to answer
        - Multi-stage sampling

## Multi-stage sampling

Surveys are generally designed to:

## Intra-haul correlation

Sampling clusters of fish that have similar characteristics (e.g. length)

- Results in samples with positive intra-haul correlation
    - Reduces effective sample size

## **Reality is complicated** {data-background=graphics/school_light.png data-background-size=cover}

- **Dynamic abundance**
- **Spatial aggregation**
- **Survey design**
- **_Objective: build a simulation that emulates reality_**


## Simulate abundance

- Common cohort model
    - $N_{a,y} = N_{a-1,y-1} e^{-Z_{a-1,y-1}}$
- First year filled via exponential decay
    -  $N_{a,1} = N_{a-1,1} e^{-Z_{a-1,1}}$
- Random-walk in recruitment
    - $log(N_{1,y}) = log(\mu_r) + \epsilon_{y}$, where $\epsilon_{y} \sim N(\epsilon_{y - 1}, \sigma_{r}^{2})$
- Total mortality correlated across ages and years
    - $log(Z_{a,y}) = log(\mu_Z) + \delta_{a,y}$, where $\delta_{a,y} \sim N(0, \Sigma_{a,y})$
        - Using covariance, $\Sigma_{a,y}$, described in Cadigan [-@Cadigan2016]

## Simulate abundance {.tighter}

### Trend in total abundance

<dev class = "left">
```{r}
plot_trend(sim) %>% 
  tight_layout(yaxis = list(rangemode = "tozero"),
               margin = list(l = 70, r = 0, t = 0, b = 40, pad = 0))
```
</dev>

## Simulate abundance {.tighter}

### Trend in abundance at age

<dev class = "left">
```{r}
plot_surface(sim) %>% tight_layout()
```
</dev>

## Simulate spatial aggregation

- Generate a square grid of $s$ locations, resolution $R$ and a depth gradient
- Distribute population through space and add spatial-temporal noise
    - $log(N_{a,y,s}) = log(N_{a,y}) + \eta_{a,y,s}$
    - $\eta_{a,y,s}$ includes parabolic relationship with depth and covariance between ages, years and space
        - $\eta_{a,y,s} = \frac{(d_s - \mu_{d}) ^ 2}{2 \sigma_d^2} + \xi_{a,y,s}$
        - $\xi_{a,y,s}$ is a combination of Mat√©rn covariance and the age-year covariance described in Cadigan [-@Cadigan2016]

### Square grid with depth gradient

        text = ~depth) %>%

### Distribution for ages 1-6 in years 1-6

  tight_layout(margin = list(l = 0, r = 0, t = 40, b = 0, pad = 0))
```
</dev>


## Simulate survey

- Split grid into $N_{div}$ divisions and $N_{strat}$ depth-based strata
- Set allocation defined by specifying set density, $D_{sets}$
- Binomial sampling was used to simulate catch:
    - $n_{a,y,s} \sim Bin(N_{a,y,s}, \frac{A_{trawl}}{A_{cell}} q_a )$
    - Accounts for trawl size relative to cell size, $\frac{A_{trawl}}{A_{cell}}$, and catchability, $q_a$ (controlled using a logistic curve)
    
## Simulate survey

- Lengths simulated using the original von Bertalanffy growth curve [@Cailliet2006]:
    - $log(l) = log(l_{\infty} - (l_{\infty} - l_0) e^{-Ka}) + \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma_{l}^2)$
- Sub-sampling is then conducted
    - A maximum number of lengths are measured per set, $M_{lengths}$
    - A maximum number of ages, $M_{ages}$, are sampled per length group, $l_{group}$, per division

```
</dev>

## Settings and analysis {.build}

- Roughly based simulation on 3Ps Cod
- A series of 175 surveys were tested

|      **Parameter name** |      **Symbol** |                                       **Setting** |
|:----------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
|             Set density |      $D_{sets}$ |    0.0005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01 sets / km^2^ |
|  Length sampling effort |   $M_{lengths}$ |       5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 lengths / set |
|     Age sampling effort |      $M_{ages}$ |   2, 5, 10, 20, 50 ages / length group / division |


## Settings and analysis

- Each survey was run 1000 times over the same population
- Abundance estimates, $\hat{I}_{a,y,k}$, were obtained using a stratified analysis [@Smith1981]
- Used root-mean-squared error (RMSE) as a measure of the precision and bias of the abundance estimates from each survey:
    - $RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{ \sum_{a = 1}^{N_a} \sum_{y = 1}^{N_y} \sum_{k = 1}^{N_k} (\hat{I}_{a,y,k} - I_{a,y})}{N_a N_y N_k}}$
    - Where $I_{a,y}$ is the true abundance available to the survey
- Powered by R and worked into a package (https://github.com/PaulRegular/SimSurvey)

## Truth vs. estimate {.smaller}

### Recap

- **Sets = primary sampling unit**
    - Only way to improve stratified estimates of total abundance
    - Best way to improve stratified estimates of abundance at age
- **Increasing length sampling does not always improve estimates**
    - At low set densities, more is worse
    - At high set densities, more is better
- **Sampling effort affects both bias and percision**
    - Stratified estimates are supposed to be unbiased?!
    - Likely related to age-specific clustering
    
## Check bias

### Turned off age-specific clustering

main_sim <- sim

                   ages = 2:6, years = sim$years, select_by = "age",
                   plot_bgcolor = "transparent", paper_bgcolor = "transparent",
                   font = list(size = 14, family = "'Montserrat', sans-serif"))

```{r}
plot_error_surface(sim) %>% 
  tight_layout(scene = surface_scene,

```
</dev>


## Check bias

### Turned off age-specific clustering

<br>

>- Increases in secondary sampling does little to improve estimates
>- Bias is negligible in this scenario


## Interpretation

Why is there bias? Why is extra sub-sampling ineffective or detrimental?

- With age-specific clustering, fish of different ages are not encountered with equal probability
    - A survey with few sets will be less likely to encounter groups in a tight cluster
        - Survey-level length / age distribution ‚à¥ more likely to be incomplete 
            - Increasing length / age sampling cannot improve perception of the population-level distribution


## Interpretation {.tighter .smaller}

Ages caught and sampled in year 18 from one survey scenario:

>- $D_{sets} = 0.002, M_{lengths} = 500, M_{ages} = 10$

<dev class = "left">
```{r, fig.height = 4.8}

samp <- merge(main_sim$setdet, main_sim$samp, by = "set")
samp <- samp[sim == 1 & year == 18, ]
caught <- as.data.frame(table(samp$age))
caught <- data.frame(group = "Caught", age = caught$Var1, freq = caught$Freq,
                     prop = caught$Freq / sum(caught$Freq))
measured <- as.data.frame(table(samp$age[samp$measured]))
measured <- data.frame(group = "Sampled", age = measured$Var1, freq = measured$Freq,
                       prop = measured$Freq / sum(measured$Freq))
true <- data.frame(group = "True", age = sim$ages, freq = sim$I[, 1],
                   prop = sim$I[, 1] / sum(sim$I[, 1]))
d <- rbind(caught, measured, true)

plot_ly(data = d) %>% 
  add_lines(x = ~age, y = ~prop, color = ~group,
            colors = rev(viridis::viridis(3))) %>% 
  tight_layout(xaxis = list(title = "Age"),
               yaxis = list(title = "Proportion"),
               margin = list(r = 60))

```
</dev>

## Conclusions

Increasing sub-sampling effort may be an inefficient means of improving population estimates

- Large catches are relatively infrequent
    - Samples in large sets are not independent
        - If the goal is to maximize information, it is likely better to stop collecting psudoreplicates and, instead, focus efforts on other species or the next set


## Potential future directions

- Taylor to other species and assess sampling protocol
- Add a time component to assess trade-offs / efficiency
- Assess the effects of
    - Missing strata
    - Variable trawl area
- Use this as a platform to test spatial models
- Use as an operating model for an MSE
- Others?
