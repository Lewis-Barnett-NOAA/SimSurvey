\title{Simulate recruitment and natural mortality}
\usage{
sim_R(mean = 20000, sd = 4)

sim_Z(mean = 0.4, sd = 0.2, breaks = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean, sd}{Mean and standard deviation}

\item{breaks}{Provide breaks to age and/or year series to specify group specific
mean total mortality values. If specified, multiple mean values must be
supplied; one more than the number of breaks. Provide named lists (see
examples below).}
}
\description{
These functions return a function to use inside \code{\link{sim_abundance}}.
Given parameters, it generates R and Z values.
}
\details{
\code{sim_R} simply generates uncorrelated recruitment values from a log normal
distribution. \code{sim_Z} simulates total mortality using a random walk.
Random walk errors are first generated for years and ages independently.
The outer product of these errors are then calculated to generate a total
mortality matrix as follows:
\eqn{log(Z_{a, y}) = log(z_{a, y}) + \delta_{a, y}}{log(Z_a,y) = log(z_a,y) + e_a,y},
where \eqn{z_{a, y}}{z_a,y} are the supplied mean values.
}
\examples{
sim_abundance(R = sim_R(mean = 100000, sd = 4))
sim_abundance(Z = sim_Z(mean = 0.6, sd = 0.3))
sim_abundance(Z = sim_Z(mean = list(ages = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2)),
                      breaks = list(ages = c(1, 2)), sd = 0.3))
sim_abundance(Z = sim_Z(mean = list(ages = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2), years = c(0.3, 2, 0.3)),
                      breaks = list(ages = c(1, 2), years = c(4, 6)), sd = 0.3))
